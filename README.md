# Commands to execute the docker on an EC2

sudo dnf -y install dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager --add-repo https://download.docker.com/linux/rhel/docker-ce.repo
sudo dnf install docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io docker-buildx-plugin docker-compose-plugin

sudo systemctl restart docker

sudo systemctl enable --now docker


# add your normal user to docker group  -- because we cannot run the docker commands as a normal ec2-user

sudo usermod -aG docker ec2-user

exit, after adding normal user and re-login and start using the docker commands without giving sudo

Again after logging in

sudo systemctl start docker

sudo systemctl enable docker

# In this Repo, we are just understanding the different instructions which we use in our Dockerfile and that is the reaon we mention CMD and give a sleep command to run the container.

 # Basic Commands

docker images 
docker pull <image-name>:<tag/version> --> get the image

docker create nginx
docker ps -a --> all containers including all status
docker start <container-ID>



docker rm <container-ID>
docker run <image>:<tag> -> pull image + create container + start container
docker run -d nginx --> detach the screen

docker ps a -q ====> to display all the containers
docker rm -f 'docker ps a -q'  ====> to delete all the containers at a time

0-65,535   === total no of ports for a container

docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx
docker exec -it nginx bash
docker inspect container-name/container-ID


# General Notes

How can you create custom images to your applications?

Dockerfile --> a set of instructions to create customised images

FROM
=========
FROM almalinux:9

docker build -t from:v1 . --> current directory has Dockerfile

RUN
=========
RUN commands

RUN instructions configure the image like installing packages, doing some configurations, etc..
RUN executes at the time of image creation

systemctl start nginx --> etc/systemd/system/nginx.service

docker pull nginx -> first it checks locally, if it does not exist it checks in hub

CMD
=========
CMD executes at the time of container creation i.e at the time of docker run. there should be only one CMD instruction inside Dockerfile

COPY
=========
copies the code from local to container

ADD
=========
COPY and ADD both copies the code from local to container. but it has two more advantages

1. it can directly fetch the file from internet
2. it can directly untar the file into container
